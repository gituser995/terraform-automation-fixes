A Cloud security project built on AWS for practice. The Project involved using AWS Security Hub to detect errors in a VPC created from a Terraform state file purposely made with misconfigurations. Once the VPC was created with errors, Security Hub and Cloudwatch would  trigger SNS which would trigger a lambda function to activate the Gitlab Pipeline. The Pipeline would then connect to the S3 Bucket carrying the Terraform file with fixes and deploy the file to the region with the unsecured VPC deleting and replacing the VPC with a properly secured one.
This repository carries the state files, lambda function and gitlab yaml file that ran the pipeline.
